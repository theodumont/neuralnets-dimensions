# neuralnets-dimensions

This is a simple spreadsheet that I use to manually compute the output dimensions of any neural network, layer after layer. It does not serve as a demonstration of the beauty of the Javascript language: it was written without any Javascript experience :baby:

:pushpin: It is available at [neuralnets-dimensions](https://theodumont.github.io/neuralnets-dimensions/).

I used [this repo](https://github.com/shpulak/spreadsheet-simple) as a basis for the spreadsheet.
